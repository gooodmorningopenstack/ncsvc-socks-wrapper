ncsvc ld_preload wrapper

This wraps ncsvc and with the addition of a branch of lwip:

https://github.com/russdill/lwip/commits/tap-via-socks

provides the VPN connection via a SOCKS proxy. This means that
ncsvc no longer requires SUID root, renames /etc/resolv.conf,
messes with routes, etc.

Starting ncsvc:

LD_PRELOAD=./ncsvc_preload.so ./ncsvc -h <host> -c <cookie> -f <certfile> \
		[-l <log level, default 3>] [-p <proxy port, default 1080>]

Where cookie contains a string like:

	DSID=acc62ce6d75ba371380a5e54c01bb1ee

And certfile is obtained from your host via:

	./get_cert.sh <host> <certfile>
